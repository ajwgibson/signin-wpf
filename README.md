# KidsSignIn

This is a WPF application that we use at church to sign children into our kids environments.

The application allows a list of children to be loaded from a CSV file and then the user can pick a child and sign them into one of a number of pre-determined children's environments. If a Dymo label printer is attached to the computer and is available for use then a configurable number of labels will be printed automatically for each child signed in - that's just the way it works in our church. The data is saved back to the input CSV file automatically.
